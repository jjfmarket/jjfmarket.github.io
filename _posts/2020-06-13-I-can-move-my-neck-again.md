I had some knots in the scalene muscles in my neck that were bunching up my rib into my clavicle and making it hard
 to turn my head over my left shoulder. I guess I probably didn't move my left arm very much for a couple years. A lot of playing computer games.

Obviously this is tmi but what a perfect way to get into blogging again, by sharing something that is
 blatantly overly person with the zero people who will read this post.
 
 Hopefully will make it a habit to write some more in the future.
