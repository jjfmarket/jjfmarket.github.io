Black because the night

Interior - Day - 9AM

A messy bedroom. Sun peaks through the curtains and the room is heating up. Bottles and paraphernalia are scattered across the floor.

GAL, a young man, sifts through the stuff on the floor.

GAL "Where is it PATTY? Where did you put it?"

PATTY, a young woman with wild jet black hair, sits up in bed. Stretching, she pulls off her shirt, revealing dark brown areolas.

PATTY "I thought you had it"

PATTY fans herself with her shirt, gets to her knees, and adjusts the blinds on the window.

A beam of light shines through the window blinds, causing GAL to cover his eyes

PATTY closes the blackout curtains and GAL opens his eyes, staring at PATTY's body.

GAL "How long have we been here?"

PATTY checks her watch and lies back down.

PATTY "What the fuck do you care?"

PATTY "It's Thursday."

GAL "I had to be in court yesterday."

GAL "So did you..."

PATTY "Oh you care all of a sudden?"

GAL "Fuck PATTY, I"m only here because..."

GAL slumps onto the bed, into PATTY's lap. PATTY hands him a pipe, and he takes a hit.

PATTY "Because what? Because you skipped work? Because you can't tell your wife you've been fucking another woman for the past week?"

GAL "You wouldn't let me out..."

GAL is in the back of a sedan, driving fast down the highway.

LOBSTER BOY is passed out in shotgun as PATTY accelerates and  GAL tests the childlocked door in the back of the car.

GAL "I didn't think you were going to take me /there/..."

GAL "It's just too much, I need to go home"

LOBSTER BOY enters the room. His backpack clicnks with glass liquor bottles.

LOBSTER BOY "Hey guys, sorry that took so long"

LOBSTER BOY sets the backpack on the floor unzips it and pulls out a bottle of vodka.

LOBSTER BOY "Shots?"

PATTY, GAL, and LOBSTER BOY take turns drinking from the bottle.

PATTY puts on a record {It's too late - Shannon and the clams}

>Montage of drinking, dancing, drug use, and sexual debauchery.

Interior - Night - 5AM

PATTY is passed out on the bed, while LOBSTER BOY and GAL are slumped against the foot of it.

GAL smokes the last of the dope, and picks up the pistol which has fallen from PATTY's sleeping hand.

GAL spins the chamber of the pistol and hands it to LOBSTER BOY.

GAL "I gotta get home... If you're lucky you won't have to"

GAL stands up and leaves the room
